Hello, welcome to my portfolio website.

In this project, I am going to use various technologies to learn and create a distributed application. The technologies I will be using are:

Java (Spring Boot)
React (JavaScript)
MongoDB
Docker
This project will showcase a menu with projects I have worked on throughout my career. It will also include a login feature where you can add new projects, delete existing ones, and edit their descriptions. All this information will be stored in a MongoDB database.

The reason for using Docker is to provide an environment in which you can run the project, minimizing compilation errors due to version mismatches between the different components I'm using.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website!
